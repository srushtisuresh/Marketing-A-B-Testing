# Marketing-A-B-Testing
I have conducted A/B Testing multiple times and wanted to do a small project highlighting the basics. While there is so
much more to it, I wanted to bring out my "result-oriented" mindset by conducting the analysis on what's exactly required with the given data. Instead of
playing around and exploring it in and out, I felt that the exploratory skills had already been showcased in other projects and kills the purpose of
why I wanted to build this particular one.
